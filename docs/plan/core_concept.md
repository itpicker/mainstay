# Mainstay Core Concept: Autonomous Specialist Collaboration

Mainstay is a platform where users "hire" specialized AI agents who collaborate autonomously to achieve complex project goals. It moves beyond simple tool-triggering towards a human-like professional collaboration model.

## 1. The "Hiring" Model
- Users treat AI Agents as high-level professionals (e.g., Marketing Director, Senior Developer, Legal Expert).
- Each agent has a distinct specialty, set of tools, and professional "philosophy."
- Hiring an agent means granting them autonomy to manage a portion of the project.

## 2. Autonomous Process Management
- Unlike fixed workflows, Mainstay agents **define their own processes**.
- Based on the user's project request, specialists collaborate to establish a sequence of actions.
- The system is self-correcting; if a process step fails, the agents re-evaluate and adjust the plan without user micro-management.

## 3. Specialist Team Synergy
- Agents communicate among themselves to resolve dependencies (e.g., the Developer agent asks the Researcher for API documentation).
- Shared Project Context: Every agent "sees" the same project board and history, ensuring alignment.

## 4. Capability Expansion (Meta-Tooling)
- Agents are not limited by their initial toolkit.
- If a task requires a specific capability (e.g., a custom data parser), the agents can **design and build the tool** themselves to complete the task.
