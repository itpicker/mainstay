# Mainstay Feature Specifications (Autonomous Specialists)
- **Version**: 1.0.0
- **Written At**: 2025-12-27 16:57

## 1. Specialist Hiring & Role Management
- **Role Portfolios**: Definition of specialized agents (Developer, Researcher, Analyst, Project Manager, etc.).
- **Agent Skillsets**: Each role is equipped with specific base tools (e.g., Code Sandbox for Developers, Web Search for Researchers).
- **Hiring Interface**: A UI where users can "onboard" specific specialists to a project.

## 2. Autonomous Goal Decomposition & Assignment
- **Project Discovery**: When a user submits a project, a "Support Lead" agent interviews the user to define the scope.
- **Process Synthesis**: The Lead agent identifies which specialists need to be "hired" and generates an initial collaborative plan.
- **Dynamic Tasking**: Tasks are added to a project board and specialists autonomously "pick up" or are "assigned" relevant tasks.

## 3. Specialist Collaboration (Agent-to-Agent)
- **Inter-Agent Messaging**: A backend communication bus where agents can exchange findings or request help.
- **Shared State/Project Board**: A centralized project context that tracks the status of all sub-tasks and shared knowledge.
- **Cross-Specialist Review**: Agents can review each other's work (e.g., a Security Specialist reviewing code generated by the Developer agent).

## 4. Meta-Tooling: Context-Aware Capability Expansion
- **Gap Identification**: If a specialist identifies a missing capability, it triggers a "Tool Designer" loop.
- **Functional implementation**: The system autonomously generates, tests, and deploys a micro-service or script to serve as the missing tool.
- **Tool Sandbox**: Isolated execution of generated code to ensure system safety.

## 5. Unified Dashboard: Project Command Center
- **Team View**: Monitor which specialists are currently active and what they are working on.
- **Collaborative Thread**: A visual representation of the agent-to-agent and agent-user conversation.
- **Deliverable Gallery**: A central place to view files, reports, and code produced by the team.
